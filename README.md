# Machine-Learning-Project
This project concerns classification of images as a correct type of clothing. It requires use of three different machine learning methods (Naive Bayes and 2 of our own choice - KNN and CNN).
It includes creating implementations of LDA dimentionality reduction method as well as Naive Bayes classifier from scratch.
